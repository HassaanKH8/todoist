# Todo-List App ðŸš€

A simple and elegant Todo List app built with React. This app allows you to add, delete, and toggle tasks, while storing your tasks in the browser's `localStorage` to persist them between page refreshes.

The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, offering a scrollable list of tasks when there are too many to fit on the screen.

## Features âœ…

- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks via an input field and submit button.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.
- **Scrollable List**: The task list becomes scrollable when it exceeds a certain height.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works well on mobile and desktop.
